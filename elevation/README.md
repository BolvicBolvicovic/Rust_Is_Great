# Elevation

The main idea behind this meta-project is to improve my Rust coding skills.  
It is inspired by ideas given in an [article]("https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/rust-in-action-10-project-ideas-to-elevate-your-skills/") on the web site rust-trends.com.

## Get Ready

Before anything, if it is not done, you need to install rust on your computer.  
If you are not on Linux here it [is]("https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html").
For those on a UNIX-like, you just need to curl the following line:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
